Evaluating the performance of weighted Elo ratings and machine learning models for predicting match results in professional tennis. 

The atp_2005_2020.RData and wta_2007_2020.RData datasets are the ATP and WTA datasets used by Angelini, Candila & De Angelis (2022).
Data_Clean.csv is just the atp_2005_2020.RData dataset that has been passed through the clean() function in Angelini et al.'s welo R package.
